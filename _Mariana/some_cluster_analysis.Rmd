## Now that we have the sentiments in a table kmeans clustering will be straightforward. I will use MG's lovely code for this part 


k <- 8
vpc <- NULL #vpc here means "variance per cluster"
for (i in 1:k) {
  kfit <- kmeans(prop_8sent[,2:9], i)
  vpc <- c(vpc, kfit$betweenss/kfit$totss)
}
vpc

plot(1:k, vpc, xlab = "# of clusters", ylab = "explained variance")

#looks like 3 or 4 cluster will be best

kfit3 <- kmeans(prop_8sent[,2:9], 3)


kfit4 <- kmeans(prop_8sent[,2:9], 4)  #there is a considerable difference in groupings when using 3 groups vs 4 groups

kfit7 <- kmeans(prop_8sent[,2:9],7)

#clustering means were given for each of the eight emotions...
kfit$centers

#install.packages("factoextra")

library(factoextra)

row.names(prop_8sent) <- all_8sent$names_8sent #changing the row names so they will show up as labels for each point


fviz_cluster(kfit7, data = prop_8sent[,2:9],
             palette = c("deepskyblue", "cyan3", "gold1", "pink3", "purple2", "red", "salmon4"), 
             geom = c("point", "text"),
             ellipse = F,
             ellipse.type = "t", 
             ggtheme = theme_bw()
)




test <- cbind (all_8sent, kfit$cluster)
test[test$`kfit$cluster` == 4,]
test[test$`kfit$cluster` == 3,]
test[test$`kfit$cluster` == 2,]  
test[test$`kfit$cluster` == 1,] #these are the artists in shakespeare's cluster
