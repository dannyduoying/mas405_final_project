\section{Overview}

As a prominent music label, we care about artists that are truly outstanding and stand the trial of time. Out of 45 top artists, Nickelback, Amy Winehouse, and Cake are those artists due to the similarity between their work and Shakespeare's timeless sonnets. By leveraging Natural Language Processing algorithms, our label can predict future success based on the proven success of the past.

\section{Methodology}

Before employing Natural Language Processing methods such as Keyword Extraction and Sentiment Analysis, we first obtained our data containing 154 Shakespeare's sonnets and songs of 45 modern top artists. The unit of observation is an artist and their work. The data is stored on AWS RDS for portability.

\subsection{Keyword Extraction}

One of the NLP methods we used is Keyword Extraction. This algorithm returns the most frequently used keywords from Shakespeare and the 45 artists. Figure 1 provides an example of using Keyword Extraction to create a word cloud using the most used keyword by Shakespeare.

We compared the similarity between keywords for Shakespeare and the artists using first the number of similar words and then the Euclidean distance of frequency of these words. The result ranking is shown in Table 2.

\begin{table}
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
		\centering
		\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
		\begin{tabular}{lrrlr}
 		 \hline
			Word Rank & Artist & Word Count & Frequency & Keyword \\ 
 		 \hline
  			1 &  adele &   3 & 626.00 &  love time heart\\ 
  			2 &  nickelback &   3 & 11349.00 &  love time yet \\ 
  			3 &  bieber &   2 & 648.00 &  love time\\ 
  			4 &  dolly-parton &   2 & 685.00 &  love time \\ 
  			5 &  dj-khaled &   2 & 928.00 &  mine time \\ 
  			6 &  amy-winehouse &   2 & 3700.00 &  love time \\ 
  			7 &  bjork &   2 & 5341.00 &  love yet \\ 
  			8 &  leonard-cohen &   2 & 5972.00 &  love time \\ 
  			9 &  cake &   2 & 7690.00 &  love time \\ 
 			 10 &  paul-simon &   2 & 8464.00 &  love time \\ 
   		\hline
		\end{tabular}%

\end{table}

Based on this table, Adele, Nickelback and Bieber are the top 3 artists most similar to Shakespeare.

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}

Another NLP method we used is Sentiment Analysis. More specifically, we analyzed Shakepeare's and artists' work using 8 emotions such as anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust to observe similarities and differences. Using k means clustering with 10 clusters, we observed clear trends between the artists:

\end{center}

Using Euclidean distance on the proportion of emotions, we found that Shakespeare's emotions through sonnets are most similar to the following artists:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\resizebox{6cm}{1.7cm}{%
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
  \hline
Artist & Sent. Euclidean Distance & Sentiment Rank \\ 
  \hline
eminem & 0.00 &   1 \\ 
  nirvana & 0.00 &   2 \\ 
  cake & 0.00 &   3 \\ 
  amy-winehouse & 0.00 &   4 \\ 
  bob-dylan & 0.00 &   5 \\ 
  bob-marley & 0.00 &   6 \\ 
  johnny-cash & 0.00 &   7 \\ 
  nickelback & 0.00 &   8 \\ 
  britney-spears & 0.00 &   9 \\ 
  rihanna & 0.00 &  10 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Ranked Top 10 Most Similar Music Artist to Shakespeare Based on Sentiments} 
\label{tab:wordranktable}
\end{table}

Based on this table, Eminem, Nirvana, and Cake are the top 3 artists most similar to Shakespeare based on sentiment.

\section{Results}

Combining the rankings obtained by Keyword Extraction and Sentiment Analysis, our final ranking is following:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\resizebox{8cm}{2cm}{%
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
  \hline
Artist & Word Rank & Sentiment Rank & Overall Rank \\ 
  \hline
nickelback &   2 &   8 &  10 \\ 
  amy-winehouse &   6 &   4 &  10 \\ 
  cake &   9 &   3 &  12 \\ 
  adele &   1 &  21 &  22 \\ 
  joni-mitchell &  11 &  11 &  22 \\ 
  leonard-cohen &   8 &  17 &  25 \\ 
  paul-simon &  10 &  22 &  32 \\ 
  blink-182 &  18 &  14 &  32 \\ 
  bob-marley &  27 &   6 &  33 \\ 
  rihanna &  25 &  10 &  35 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular} %
}
\caption{Ranked Top 10 Most Similar Music Artist to Shakespeare} 
\label{tab:overallranktable}
\end{table}


We show that Nickelback, Amy Winehouse, Cake, Adele, and Joni Mitchell are top 5 closest with Shakespeare using the two NLP methods. More interesting findings include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Using Key Word extraction, we compared the top 10 most frequent key words in both Shakepeare sonnets and artist songs. We found that Adele and Disney both share 3 same key words: “love”, “time”, and “heart”
\item Using Sentiment Analysis, we compared emotions such as anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust within the sonnets and songs. We found that Bob Dylan is the closest in emotions with Shakespeare. Some of Dylan’s famous songs include “Like a Rolling Stone” and “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna-Fall”. Dylan was also the first musician to win Nobel Prize in Literature "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition".
\item Despite being number one on keyword, Adele was not amongst the top 10 closest artists to Shakespeare because Adele’s use of love is more of a fear and trust while Shakespeare uses love in a fear and sadness way.
\item Amy Winehouse and Joni Mithcell are tied for number one spot closest to Shakespeare. Amy Winehouse scored 4th in Word Extraction and 5th in Sentiment, while Joni Mitchell socred 5th in Word Extraction and 4th in Sentiment.  [insert the 3 ranking tables]

\end{itemize}


\section{Limitations \& Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}

\item The R package for analyzing sentiment offers different results when collapse the sonnets into a single corpus vs not collapsing the sonnets. We would get more accurate results not collapsing, but more consistent result collapsing. In this case, we collapsed all the sonnets into one single corpus, but recognize that the result might differ if we analyze sonnets and songs without collapsing.
\item The 45 artists we chose are already outstanding. Therefore, we could look into each individual songs or more artists to derive further results.

\end{itemize}
