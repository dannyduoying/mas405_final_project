\section{Introduction}
test to make sure the citations work 
here we cite \cite{web1} our glorius leader \cite{web2} yeah yeah cool cool \cite{briney2015data} and this too \cite{monkey} this as well \cite{sonnetsData} woohooo!!! \cite{musicData} and \cite{syuzhet} and \cite{tm} and \cite{shakeFacts}

William Shakespeare is a world-renowned poet from 16th-century England. In his lifetime of 52 years, he wrote 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and many poems\cite{shakeFacts}. William Shakespeare has recognition for being one of the most revolutionary Literarry Artists to this date\cite{shakeFacts}. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations states that William Shakespeare wrote close to one tenth of the most quoted lines ever written or spoken in English\cite{shakeFacts}. Shakespeare is also the second most quoted English writer after the writers of the bible\cite{shakeFacts}. Through his work, Shakespear introduced almost  3,000 words to the English language, these words can still be found in the Oxford English Dictionary today\cite{shakeFacts}! Shakespeare has an incredible ability to deeply express emotions through his work. Reders have been inspired and moved by his work for centuries. Shakespeare changed the world through his literary works. That is why William Shakespear is the best candidate to analyze and see how his Literary work compares to modern-day music artists song lyrics. 

For this project we will be analzing Shakespeare's words and usage of emotion from his 154 sonnets from the Gutenberg Project\cite{sonnetsData}. We will then compare these words and emotions to another dataset of 45 different modern-day music artists and their song lyrics\cite{musicData}. Our interest is seeing which music artists song lyrics are the most similar to Shakespeare's sonnets in the aspect of two categories, similarities words used and similarities in emotions expressed. Then we will see which modern-day music artist is the most similar to Willam Shakspare.  

In order to answer this question, we are going to use various methods of Text Analysis, analysis of unorganized text data\cite{monkey}. The different forms of Text Analysis that we will be using for this project are Sentiment Analysis and Keyword Extraction. Sentiment Analysis involves analyzing the text and being able to extract the different emotions the text is expressing\cite{monkey}. Keyword Extraction analyzes the text and identifies which words appear most frequently in the text, these words are called Keywords\cite{monkey}. The combination of these two methods will bring the result of which music artist is the most similar to shakespear in therms of types of words used and which music artist is the most similar to Shakespeare in terms of emotion expressed through words.
